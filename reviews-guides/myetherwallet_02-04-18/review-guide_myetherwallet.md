# MyEtherWallet Review and User-Guide

MyEtherWallet (MEW) is a browser tool for receiving, sending, and storing Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and other [ERC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERC20) tokens. Originally released in 2015, MEW is open source, free, and in active development on [Github](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet).

MEW provides users with a light weight method of interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. The benefits of MEW are that you don't have to download or store the entire blockchain, all of your private information is generated and stored on your computer, and MEW can be used in combination with [hardware wallets](https://unhashed.com/best-bitcoin-ethereum-altcoin-wallet-reviews/#hardware) for added security.

## MyEtherWallet Review

### Ease of Use

MyEtherWallet's main benefit is its ease of use. With MEW you can create a new wallet and be interacting with the Ethereum network within minutes. MEW runs in a web browser and uses very few resources of your computer.

As opposed to most wallet solutions, MEW does not require downloading blockchain data. MEW's small footprint and usability has made it one of the most popular ways to use ETH and tokens.

### Aesthetics

Visually, MyEtherWallet does leave something to be desired. The page is a bit busy with a red warning at the top which doesn't ever go away. Although, after you use the wallet a few times you almost don't even notice the aesthetic shortcomings.

### Security

MEW leaves security in your hands. The wallet is only a tool which connects to the Ethereum network, it does not store private keys. MEW uses javascript code to generate and store private keys on your computer, as opposed to online wallets which generate and store your private keys on their servers.

This means that if your computer is compromised your keys could be stolen. That is why it's [recommended](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html) to use a hardware wallet in combination with MEW.

### Unique Features

You can get an idea of how much this wallet can do by taking a look at the navigation bar.

Some of the more notable features are: swapping between BTC and ETH, creating and interacting with smart contracts, registering with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), and selling registered domains.

## MyEtherWallet User Guide

### 1. Create a new wallet.

In a web browser, go to https://myetherwallet.com. You'll have to click through about 10 pages of introductions, warnings, and best practices. It can be a little annoying, but the information provided is useful.

After the pop-ups, the first page your presented with is the `New Wallet` page. Here you set a password and click the `Create New Wallet` button. Always keep a backup of your password.

### 2. Backup your keystore file.

You'll be brought to the first backup of your wallet. This backup will be an encrypted keystore file. This file, in combination with your password, will unlock your wallet. If a thief gets this file they won't be able to use it without knowing or guessing your password.

Click `Download Keystore File (UTC / JSON)` button, then select the download location and filename.

When the download is finished you can click the `I understand. Continue.` button.

### 3. Backup your private key.

This is the last of the standard backup procedures, saving your private key. This key is unencrypted and does not need a password to use. If you lose your keystore file and/or your password, the private key will still give you access to your funds. If a thief gets your private key they don't need anything else to steal your funds.

Click the `Print Paper Wallet` button.

You'll be brought to another tab where you will see what your printable private key looks like.

![print privkey pic](/reviews-guides/myetherwallet_02-04-18/myetherwallet-media/myether_privkey-paper_cropped.png)

When you are ready to print, close this tab and you will be see your print options. After printing you can click the `Save Your Address.` button.

### 4. Access your wallet.

Now that you have secured two backup types, it's time to test that you can successfully unlock your wallet with them. The next page your brought to will give you some options for unlocking your wallet. You may select `Keystore File (UTC / JSON)` or `Private Key` since you have both.

If you choose to use the keystore file, you'll need the file and your password. Once you have selected your keystore file and entered your password you can click the `Unlock` button.

If you choose to use your private key, you will not need a password. Once you have entered your private key you can click the `Unlock` button.

![unlock privkey pic](/reviews-guides/myetherwallet_02-04-18/myetherwallet-media/myether_login-privkey_cropped.png)

After successfully unlocking your wallet you will be able to scroll down to where you can see your address for receiving Ether and tokens. You can also check your balance and make additional backups here.
