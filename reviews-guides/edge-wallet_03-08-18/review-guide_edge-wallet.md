Since 2014 the Edge development team have been on the forefront of user friendly security solutions.

## Edge Wallet Review

### Ease of Use

The Edge team has given strong attention to user friendliness in their wallet. The process of creating a new account and beginning to use the wallet takes only a minute; requiring just a username, password, and pin. Restoring from a lost device is just as easy. Simply install Edge wallet on your new device and enter your username and password. You'll restore your wallet exactly as it was on the old device.

As soon as you log in the first time you are ready to begin receiving Bitcoin and Ether. Once you have some of any cryptocurrency in the wallet, you can easily send or swap it for any other supported coin or token using their built-in exchange feature.

### User Interface

The presentation of the wallet is sleek, simple, and easy to understand. There are just four main screens: "Wallets", "Request", "Send", and "Exchange". This keeps the wallets flow intuitive, instead of having to tap through endless pages trying to find where you want to be.

From the main wallet page you can backup your wallets seeds, add new cryptocurrency wallets, or manage your Ethereum tokens. Another useful feature, the sending page gives you an option to adjust the miners fee. The most interesting part of the UI is it's direct integration with [Shapeshift](https://info.shapeshift.io/about). This allows Edge wallet to swap between currencies with almost as little effort as sending a normal transaction.

### Supported Currencies

Since Edge was only released recently, there is currently only native support for five cryptocurrencies and two ERC20 tokens.

There is a way to [add more tokens](https://blog.edgesecure.co/how-to-add-erc20-tokens-to-edge-4c4951c3a8cc) easily from within the wallet, however it remains unknown when other cryptocurrencies will be added or which ones they will be. Until Edge wallet matures a bit, users storing a larger portfolio of coins might want to try [Jaxx wallet](https://unhashed.com/cryptocurrency-wallet-review/jaxx/) on a mobile device and PC, or the [Ledger Nano S](https://unhashed.com/cryptocurrency-wallet-review/ledger-nano-s/) hardware wallet.

### Security

Unfortunately, I came to the conclusion that Edge seems to be more concerned with providing an easy experience for the user than a secure one. Having only a username and password required to restore your wallet on a new device is scary to say the least. Users will tend to use the same username/password combination that they use for everything. Making [data breaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) at other companies a treasure trove of keys to possibly unlock Edge wallets remotely.

There is much more to be worried about than just data breaches. What if you unlock your wallet in public and someone watches you type in your account info, or a scorned ex knows your favorite login details? Edge wallets use of a pin to login after wallet creation limits the possibility of your account being shoulder surfed in public. Nonetheless, the list of possible ways to lose control of your username and password remains endless.
