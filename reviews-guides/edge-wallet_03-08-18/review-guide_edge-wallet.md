# Edge Wallet Review and User-Guide

Edge is a mobile wallet for Android and IOS devices created by the Airbitz team. Edge supports receiving, sending, storing, and exchanging between different cryptocurrencies, as well as ERC20 tokens.

Since 2014 the Edge development team has been working on user friendly security solutions. Beginning with a Bitcoin wallet, they have since grown to creating a new security model dubbed "[Edge Security](https://edgesecure.co/about/)" and improving the wallet to support multiple currencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC).

## Edge Wallet Review

### Ease of Use

The Edge team has given strong attention to user friendliness in their wallet. The process of creating a new account and beginning to use the wallet takes only a minute; requiring just a username, password, and pin. Restoring from a lost device is just as easy. Simply install Edge wallet on your new device and enter your username and password. You'll restore your wallet exactly as it was on the old device.

As soon as you log in the first time you are ready to begin receiving Bitcoin and Ether. Once you have some of any cryptocurrency in the wallet, you can easily send or swap it for any other supported coin or token using their built-in exchange feature.

### User Interface

The presentation of the wallet is sleek, simple, and easily navigated. There are just four main screens: "Wallets", "Request", "Send", and "Exchange". This keeps the wallets flow intuitive, instead of having to tap through endless pages trying to find where you want to be.

From the main wallet page you can backup your seeds, add new cryptocurrency wallets, or manage your Ethereum tokens. Another useful feature, the sending page gives you an option to adjust the miners fee. The most interesting part of the app is it's direct integration with [Shapeshift](https://info.shapeshift.io/about). This allows Edge wallet users to swap between currencies in just two simple steps.

### Supported Currencies

Edge was just released on February 15th of this year, so the wallet only has native support for five cryptocurrencies and two tokens at this time.

You may [add any ERC20 tokens](https://blog.edgesecure.co/how-to-add-erc20-tokens-to-edge-4c4951c3a8cc) easily from within the wallet, however it remains unknown when other cryptocurrencies will be added or which ones they will be. Until Edge wallet matures a bit, users storing a larger portfolio of coins might want to try Jaxx wallet for mobile devices and desktops, or the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet.

### Security

Mobile devices are generally known for being the least secure way to store cryptocurrencies. There is not a single mobile wallet that should be trusted for large amounts or long term storage. Even [Edge themselves](https://support.edgesecure.co/support/solutions/articles/8000058679-how-much-money-is-safe-to-put-on-edge-) suggest to only use the wallet for small amounts.

The convenience of restoring your wallet on a new device with only a username and password may seem helpful, but it is also a security problem. End users are notorious for creating easily guessed credentials, that are then used on multiple accounts across the internet. This makes [data breaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_breaches) at other sites a possible security threat for Edge wallet users.

If you need a strong security option, the safest choice is always a [hardware wallet](https://unhashed.com/best-bitcoin-ethereum-altcoin-wallet-reviews/#hardware).

## Edge Wallet User Guide

### 1. Install the app.

Edge wallet can be installed from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.edgesecure.app), [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/edge-bitcoin-wallet/id1344400091?mt=8), or directly from the [Edge site](https://edgesecure.co).

### 2. Create an account.

On the first run of the app you will need to create an account. You will need to create a username, password, and 4 digit pin. These account details are used to encrypt your wallet info on Edge servers in case you lose or break your device. So be sure to use a username and password that have never been used for any other account.

After creating your pin you are conveniently given the opportunity to backup your data. After writing down a backup of your account credentials, you just have to verify some information and your wallet is ready to use.
