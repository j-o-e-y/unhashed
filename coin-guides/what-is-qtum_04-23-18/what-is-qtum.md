# What is Qtum

## Intro

Qtum (pronounced "quantum") is a blockchain system that combines what they see as the best parts of Bitcoin and Ethereum to create a superior solution for industrial scale businesses. Founded in 2016 by Patrick Dai of the Singapore-based Qtum Foundation, they raised $16.6M in two rounds of a crowdfunding ICO in early 2017.

Qtum was built by combining Bitcoin's base transaction layer with Ethereum's smart contracts and proof-of-stake consensus. Their goal is provide the tools and framework necessary to execute Ethereum style smart contracts and Dapps on a Turing-complete and globally scalable blockchain, targeted for use by big industries.

By creating a foundation based on Bitcoin and Ethereum, Qtum is able to make use of many of the already available tools that exist for each of these coins. Since their developers don't have to spend time bootstrapping all of their software from scratch, they can focus instead on writing the code that they hope will bring these technologies to next level.

### Team

Qtum has a [team](https://qtum.org/en/team) of 18 people worldwide. They are made up of individuals from both the Bitcoin and Ethereum space, as well as from companies and institutions outside of cryptocurrency. The group is both young and experienced with a passion for pushing blockchain technologies beyond their current limits.

The lead developer is [Jordan Earls](https://github.com/earlz), a self taught coder from the age of 13 with an impressive history of open source projects that includes a [review](https://github.com/Earlz/coinreviews) of over 200 cryptocurrencies. This undoubtedly gives Jordan a deep and thorough understanding of the history of blockchain development which should lead to faster and more effective progress for Qtum.

Jordan, together with about 6 members of the Qtum team, have contributed most of the code to their Github repo. However, since they share a code base, Qtum can pull in upgrades from Bitcoin's repo. This is exactly the point of open source development, and it's very smart of the Qtum team to take advantage of the robust development that happens on Bitcoin's code. It's also worth mentioning that the Qtum developers always give proper attribution when they borrow code from Bitcoin. In my opinion, this says something positive about their ethics.

### Goals

In the long term, on a high level, Qtum's goal is to act as the bridge which connects legacy industries with the future. They aspire to make smart contracts, distributed applications, and ERC20 tokens easier to use, more secure, and more scalable specifically for businesses. By providing click-and-play solutions that are adaptable to many cases, they can offer decreased cost and improved efficiency to industries such as mobile telecoms, industrial logistics, manufacturing, etc.

The current objectives of the Qtum development team are all about gearing up for the future. Already having success on their testnet, the x86 Virtual Machine should be on the mainnet in late 2018, which will be the third platform for smart contract execution after Solidity and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This will provide the resources for contracts that can process more data and be written in a larger number of languages, making the procedure of coding a contract more familiar to traditional developers.

One of Qtum's intentions is to make it possible for users to not need a PC or laptop, and already you can create and interact with smart contracts via their mobile app. Coming soon the team will introduce a lightweight SPV wallet, hardware wallet integration, they plan to build more robust developer tools, they will add the lightning network for scalability, and there are plans to create a Dapp store.

## How Does Qtum Work

### Technical info

Qtum's technological claim to fame is their unique [Account Abstraction Layer](https://qtum.org/en/account-abstraction-layer-overview). Which 

### Transactions (if applicable)
### Mining (if applicable)
### Development Status/Future plans
Can pull from Ethereum and Bitcoin development, benefit from their contributions.
### Address scaling (if applicable)
### Partnerships (if applicable)
The Qtum project was first funded by $1 million in investments from various backers to build their testnet and initial software. 3 months later, in March 2017, with a working model, they were able to raise an additional $15.6 million in just 5 days. At this time, the Qtum project is backed by 10 investors.
