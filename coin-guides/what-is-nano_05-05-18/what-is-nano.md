# What is Nano Cryptocurrency? | The Ultimate Beginners Guide

## Intro

Nano (NANO), formerly Raiblocks (XRB), aims to be a cryptocurrency which maintains the philosophy of "do one thing, and do it right." Some of Nano's features are instant transactions, no fees, and infinite scalability potential. There is no mining, no incentive structure, and each wallet stores a blockchain of its own transactions. This is all done in an effort to maximize the efficiency of cryptographic value transfer.

The project was created in 2014 by Colin LeMahieu as a solution to what he sees as design failures in Bitcoin. Above all else, Nano strives to be a cryptocurrency that can be adopted by a large portion of the world with minimal impact. The team believes this can be achieved by limiting the amount of data that needs to be stored and by using the least amount of energy possible to maintain the ledger.

### Team

Leading the Nano team is Colin LeMahieu, the creator of the project and author of the [white paper](https://nano.org/en/whitepaper). There is a 12 person [team](https://nano.org/en/team/) working with Colin from a range of backgrounds. Most of them have about 10 years of experience in some sort of software or technical development, with a couple of them bringing more business related skills to the table.

### Goals

Nano's aspirations, as outlined in their white paper, are to solve three problems with Bitcoin:

>1)  Poor scalability: Each block in the blockchain can store a limited amount of data, which means the system can only  process  so  many  transactions  per  second,  making spots  in  a  block  a  commodity.  Currently  the  median transaction fee is $10.38.
>2)  High  latency:  The  average  confirmation  time  is  164 minutes.
>3)  Power inefficient: The Bitcoin network consumes an estimated 27.28TWh per year, using on average 260KWh per transaction.

### Place in Industry



## How Does Nano Work?

### Distribution of Coins

Under the hood, Nano is really a completely different technology than most other crypto projects. To begin with, the issuance of coins was done completely through faucet sites. In 2015 the team released faucet sites that would give users NANO for solving CAPTCHAs, the original site would give 1,000 NANO at a time. The coins are now 100% issued with about 130 million NANO given through faucets, 7 million sent to a [developers fund](https://nano.org/en/explore/block/4270F4FB3A820FE81827065F967A9589DF5CA860443F812D21ECE964AC359E05), and the remaining 200+ million were [destroyed](https://nano.org/en/explore/block/ECCB8CB65CD3106EDA8CE9AA893FEAD497A91BCA903890CBD7A5C59F06AB9113).

This method of faucet distribution was meant to give the developers incentive to continue improving the code, negate inflation, and give a fair distribution of the coins. However, there is no way to verify whether this ultimately led to diversification in stake holders or created some whales that found a way to exploit the faucets. As a matter of fact, there's no way to prove whether the faucets were the only distribution method, the developers could have very easily sent funds to any address without notice.

### Transactions

Two of Nano's key selling points and free and instant transactions. They're able to achieve these because of a series of design choices. The first step was to create their own method for double spend protection, which involves using accounts instead of addresses. Accounts look and act like normal addresses from the outside, but they operate differently behind the scenes. Instead of transactions building up in a pool and waiting on the next block, like Bitcoin, Nano uses a [directed acyclic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAG) which can be updated without order.

In Ethereum, which also makes use of a DAG, nodes record all changes to every account. This creates an enormous amount of data that is retained on their blockchain, currently over 180GB. For Nano this was not an option since one of their design goals is to maintain a small footprint. Nano's solution is for each account to record every deposit and withdraw as individual blocks on their personal blockchain. The DAG is then periodically updated with only the final balance, keeping its current size to 4GB. This communication of transactions between the individual blockchains of each account has been dubbed a "[block lattice](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/Block-lattice)."

In order to keep transactions free, which Colin believes is a necessary feature, there must be something done to prevent spam. Inevitably there will be bad actors that will use free transactions as an attack vector. To defend against this Nano has implemented a small amount of proof-of-work that the sender and receiver must do for each transaction. The work is negligible and can be completed in less than two seconds on a cheap laptop. In an effort to make transactions instant, Nano wallets will do this work ahead of time in preparation of the next transaction.

Now, I have to point out a couple of facts about Nano's claim to free and instant transactions. First, I don't believe that transactions are free because the users are paying for them with PoW. Not just to send either, in Nano's system, users pay with PoW to send and to receive transactions.

The second point I would like to make is that transactions are not instant. They only seem instant if you don't send or receive transactions in rapid succession. Depending on the power of your computer, you will eventually get stuck with a transaction backlog while waiting on the PoW. The only way to increase the speed of the work is to build an expensive mining rig, which is even more evidence to support my first point.

### Mining

In his continuing effort to reduce energy expenditure, Colin has decided against PoW for securing the Nano blockchain. Alternatively, he decided to use a delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) system. In PoS systems, double spend attempts are prevented against by a voting system weighted by the number of coins staked. For coins to be staked their wallet has to remain connected to the network the entire time, which is not feasible for most users and could pose a security hazard.

Nano's DPoS works the same as a typical PoS system, only without the necessity of keeping a hot wallet online 24/7.  In this system users whose coins are not online delegate their votes to representatives that do stay online. This gives users the ability to stake from cold storage. It also, unfortunately, leads to centralization of the weighted voting power on the network. This is because Nano wallets have default nodes that they delegate to, and most users don't change the defaults. This has resulted in the known nodes of the developers controlling over 50% of the voting power.

This centralization is likely to get worse as time goes on because of the fact that there is no incentive structure. Without transaction fees or new coins to collect there are very few reasons why a user would want to run a voting node. If adoption takes off, and sophisticated attacks begin occurring, running a voting node may require special hardware. Then, even if users wanted to support the network by running an honest node, most wouldn't be able to.

### Future Plans

Nano's [roadmap](https://developers.nano.org/roadmap/) is focused on improving the user experience, adoption, user interfaces, and the protocol itself. The first point made is that the team plans to maintain accurate and helpful documentation in order to ease user and service adoption. In another effort to increase use, the team is working on Point-of-Sale software that is designed to work on hardware wallets, mobile wallets, or existing Point-of-Sale systems.

In a move that will improve the protocol, user experience, and adoption all at once, the team plan to implement Universal Blocks. At this moment, Nano has 4 different types of blocks on the network: send, receive, open, and change. The Universal Blocks upgrade will consolidate all of these to one block type. This will improve ledger pruning and make transactions easier to create and validate. Once the transaction operations become more efficient, the team is hoping the door will open to hardware wallet integration.

Coming up in the very near future are the new desktop and mobile wallets from the core team. The most popular mobile wallets at this time are from third parties, and the core team's official desktop wallet was not built with user experience in mind. Colin and his team are hoping that they can fix this by providing users with a better desktop and mobile wallet. Right now both wallets are in private beta testing, but they should be available shortly. The final product is close enough that the developers have already released a preview of the Android app.
