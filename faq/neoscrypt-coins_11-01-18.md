# Neoscrypt Coins

When Satoshi created Bitcoin they chose SHA256 as the "work" in Proof-of-Work. SHA256 is what is known as a [hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function), it takes any data and translates it to a 256 bit string of letters and numbers that are unique to the data. This requires a measurable amount of energy to do, hence the term "work".

One seemingly negative aspect of SHA256 is that it is easy to create specialized hardware for it, known as ASICs. The manufacturers of ASICs are few and far between creating a centralization, and possibly security, threat. To combat this, the second generation of cryptocurrencies began experimenting with new types of work that would be hard or impossible to achieve with ASICs.

One of the methods of work that people began testing is known as a [Key Derivation Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function) (KDF). The first of these to be implemented was Scrypt by Tenrbrix, Fairbrix, and Litecoin. For a short while Scrypt held ASICs at bay, but eventually lost the battle. This motivated a developer to the harden the Scrypt algorithm and gave birth to Neoscrypt.

## What is Neoscrypt?

John Doering (aka [ghostlander](https://github.com/ghostlander)) created the Neoscrypt algorithm. He officially [announced](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=712650.0) it on July 27, 2013, although it had been running on Phoenixcoin's testnet since at least 13 days before.

The algorithm improves Scrypt by consuming less energy, yet being more memory intensive and employing stronger cryptography. The extra memory usage is key to remaining ASIC resistant, as adding memory to this hardware does not tend to be profitable.

Many ASIC resistant algorithms were created around this time, and almost all of them have eventually succumbed to ASIC mining domination. After 5+ years of success, it seems Neoscrypt may have lost this battle as well. In August 2018 an ASIC was [announced](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/08/28/1557351/0/en/BITTECH-Offers-the-world-first-miner-for-NeoScrypt-algorithm.html) for Neoscrypt.

## Coins Using Neoscrypt
### (in alphabetical order)

+ CrowdCoin (CRC)
+ Desire (DSR)
+ Dinero (DIN)
+ Feathercoin (FTC)
+ GoByte (GBX)
+ Innova (INN)
+ Orbitcoin (ORB)
+ Phoenixcoin (PXC)
+ Qbic (QBIC)
+ TrezarCoin (TZC)

1. [CrowdCoin](https://crowdcoin.site/)

CrowdCoin was built from scratch by its developers, and uses masternodes to give 30% of block rewards to token holders. They had an ICO from Sep. to Dec. of 2017 where the project founders sold an unspecified amount of their 400,000 premine tokens. The team's roadmap includes a platform to compliment the currency which will offer features such as training and advisory courses. The final product will also include an AML/KYC compliant exchange.

2. [Desire](https://www.desire-crypto.com)

Desire hopes to be a fast, optionally anonymous cryptocurrency that was forked from Dash and launched in November 2017. The blockchain is secured by both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake mining. The staking occurs via masternodes with rewards given out in a tier system based on coins staked. The masternodes also offer users the opportunity for mixing coins and secure instant sends.

3. [Dinero](https://dinerocoin.org/)

The Dinero currency is a fork of Dash which aspires to be a private, low fee, and ASIC resistant cryptocurrency. The founders held a presale and ICO between March and May of 2018, wherein 550,000 tokens were sold for about $55M. Another of the goals of the project is to democratically decide how funds are allocated. Therefore maternodes in the Dinero network not only provide mixing for private sends, but also vote on how to spend funds.

4. [Feathercoin](https://feathercoin.com/)

The Feathercoin project began in April 2013 by forking the Litecoin code. The aspiration was to experiment with a faster block time, a new difficulty adjustment algorithm, and ASIC resistance. Feathercoin was the second coin to implement Neoscrypt after Phoenixcoin. The lead developer and creator, Peter Bushnell, left the project in 2014. He returned in late 2017 and added features such as Lightning and BarterDEX.

5. [GoByte](https://www.gobyte.network/)

GoByte was launched in November 2017, and began by forking Dash's code. Previous to launch the team had premined an undisclosed amount of tokens and held ICO where they raised an estimated $27M. Technologically the coin is not much different from Dash, offering both instant sends and private transactions via masternodes. The only substantial difference is in the fact that GoByte has remained ASIC resistant by using Neoscrypt.

6. [Innova](https://innovacoin.info)

Launched in November 2017, Innova is a code fork of Dash. They have adopted masternodes, as well as their private send and instant transaction features. The founders premined 2.2% of the total supply, but did not have an ICO. The team wishes to be a community driven project, and plans to switch to solely Proof-of-Stake in the future.

7. [Orbitcoin](http://www.orbitcoin.org/)

Orbitcoin is a code fork of Peercoin that was launched in December 2013 by Neoscrypt's own John Doering. It uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake mining with a fixed reward for staking. This coin introduced the "Orbitcoin Super Shield" which is supposed to prevent mining pools and foster decentralization. The coin had a fair launch and is still under active development.

8. [Phoenixcoin](http://www.phoenixcoin.org/)

Phoenixcoin was the first Neoscrypt coin launched shortly before the algorithm in May 2013 by John Doering, making it one of the oldest altcoins in existence. The original code was forked from Litecoin to experiment with ASIC resistance. Phoenixcoin was used as the main payment method on PhenixPoker.com while the site existed. John hoped that the project would be a community driven effort, but got off to a bad start by attempting to premine 1,000,000 coins in secret.

9. [Qbic](https://qbic.io/)

Qbic launched in January 2018 by forking Dash's code and premining 1.5% of the supply. The coin has implemented masternodes for staking, privacy, and irreversible instant transactions. There is some [speculation](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2737347.msg27991314#msg27991314) that this coin was created by the same entity that launched GoByte, but it may just be that the announcement was poorly copy/pasted from theirs.

10. [TrezarCoin](https://trezarcoin.com)

TrezarCoin forked its code from Orbitcoin and announced their launch on September 1, 2017. They are using both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake mining algorithms. 20% of the coins were premined by the founder, with 17% being auctioned off to investors (for an undisclosed amount of Bitcoin) within the first week of launch. The team's roadmap includes inclusion in both ElectrumX and BTCPay servers, as well as activating Segwit.
