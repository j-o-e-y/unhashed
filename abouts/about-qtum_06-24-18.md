## About Qtum

Qtum is a platform for smart contracts and token issuance, as well as a cryptocurrency. Their goal is to combine Bitcoin's blockchain, Ethereum's smart contracts, Proof-of-Stake consensus, and a decentralized governance model in order to provide tools for global industries that offer scalability, security, and efficiency.

Qtum was founded in 2016 by Patrick Dai of the Singapore based company Qtum Foundation, along with lead developer Jordan Earls. Working with them is a team of about 20 individuals, participating in an open development process on [Github](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum).

The aspiration of the Qtum team is to provide a solution for international industries stuck using wasteful and inefficient methods. They feel that these businesses stand to gain a tremendous amount from the implementation of smart contracts and cryptocurrencies, if done correctly. The team at Qtum thinks they have come up with the right solution.

Instead of creating their system from scratch, Qtum built upon Ethereum's smart contracts. As a result, developers that have experience with Ethereum will be able to use Qtum without effort, and new developers will have a lower learning curve. This is because the Qtum team added popular coding languages like C++, Python, and Go to the smart contract system. They have also added an x86 interpreter which will be able to execute more complicated contracts in the future and power the next generation of distributed applications.

To circumvent Ethereum's scaling issues, Qtum decided to use Bitcoin's base layer and to focus on second layer scaling solutions. The team is working on implementing Lightning and payment channels which will allow for theoretically limitless transaction volume, and also open up the possibility for trustless atomic swaps between Qtum and any other coin on the Lightning Network.

For efficiency and ease-of-use, Qtum has decided to use Proof of Stake mining. This means that any user with at least 1 QTUM can help to secure the network and earn rewards. Also, there is no need for the energy use and investment in mining hardware associated with Proof of Work.

In an effort to reduce the probability of contentious hard forks, the Qtum team has employed a decentralized governance model. This way any fundamental changes to the system, like increased block size or a change in gas parameters, can be voted on and executed by the community.

## ICO & Price History

Qtum held an ICO from March 12 to March 17, 2017. During that time 51,000,000 of the total 100,000,000 tokens were sold at $0.30 each for a total earnings of $15,000,000. The remaining 49% of the supply will be distributed over the next 4 years as detailed in [this](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-circulating-supply-updated-791039236da0) blog post.

QTUM first hit exchanges on May 24, 2017 at a price of $6.42, with an all time high on January 1, 2018 at a price of $106.88. Qtum's current price is ${{price_usd}}, with a market cap of ${{market_cap_usd}}.
