## About Golem

Golem (GNT) is a decentralized supercomputer utilizing the computing power of users within its peer-to-peer network. Golem users can rent or sell computing power from each other using a combination of GNT (which exist as ERC20 tokens) and Ethereum smart contracts.

The Golem software acts as the backbone for the decentralized market for computing power which emerges. It will provide the infrastructure and the platform to facilitate the order book, smart contract creation and fulfillment, and code execution.

Golem was founded by Julian Zawistowski, an economist by trade, in February 2014. Julian has now moved into the CEO position. He has a [team](https://golem.network/team/) of developers which are building the project on [Github](https://github.com/golemfactory/golem) under an open source license. The official release of the software, and the beginning of Golem's network, came in August 2016.

Golem's network is made up of two types of users: providers and requesters. Providers run Golem's software and offer their excess computer resources to rent for a fee in GNT. Providers can have hardware ranging all the way from consumer grade laptops to entire data centers.

Requesters are users that need computing power, typically this is for computationally expensive tasks like rendering graphics, mapping out the complex folds of proteins, or AI learning. Requesters run Golem's software and use it to submit their needed work to the peer-to-peer network. That offer is then added to the Task Manager which is available for all users to see.

Providers can choose which orders to accept from the Task Manager, and with the aid of reputation scores (received by users based on their past interactions) each participant can fine tune their selected counterparties. Once a suitable match is made an Ethereum smart contract is created, which is then funded by the requester.

The requester now uses an [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) to send the work to the provider. On the providers side, a [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)) container is created and used to perform the computations. This container is isolated from the rest of the provider's operating system for security. Next, the provider uses the IPFS to send the completed work back to the requester. The provider may also send proof of the completed work to other nodes on the network.

When the completed work has been verified, either by the requester or other nodes that received proof, the smart contract pays out to the provider. If everything goes as planned both parties get an increase to their reputation scores.

## ICO & Price History

The 1B GNT total supply was 100% pre-mined by the Golem team. On November 13, 2016 they held a crowdsale ICO in which they sold 820M GNT tokens at a rate of $0.01 each for a total of $8.2M. The remaining 12% of the supply is held by the Golem team to fund future development.

Exchange trading of GNT began on November 18, 2016 at a market price of $0.015. The token experienced an all time high on January 8, 2018 reaching a value of $1.25. Golem's current price is ${{price_usd}}, with a market cap of ${{market_cap_usd}}.
