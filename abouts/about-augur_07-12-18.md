## About Augur

Augur (REP) is an open [source](https://github.com/AugurProject), trustless, and decentralized prediction market built on Ethereum. The Augur platform creates an economy around the fact that large groups of people are known to be more accurate than any single expert.

Augur was founded in 2014 by Joey Krug and Jack Peterson, who each maintain the roles of Senior Back-End Developer and Lead Developer, respectively. Augur was one of the first projects ever to be built on Ethereum, even attracting Vitalik Buterin to its board of [advisors](https://www.augur.net/foundation/).

The beta version of the Augur software was initially released in March 2016. The team's intent was to release their mainnet version by October 2016, however the project was delayed and didn't launch until July 2018.

The Augur market is made up of three major participants. The first is the market creator, also known as a maker. These users put forth questions to "the crowd" that they would like a prediction on. The questions can literally be anything that hasn't happened yet. Makers must spend ETH to create a market, but they can recoup some, or all, in the form of fees taken from those wishing to predict on their question.

The next group of users are what has become known as "the crowd," or market takers. They are the ones making predictions for makers, and in order to do this they must buy shares in whatever side of a prediction they think will succeed.

Takers spend ETH on their shares, and a portion goes to the maker as a fee. Takers are then free to trade their shares, or hold them to see if they predicted correctly. If they did choose the correct outcome, they will be rewarded in ETH based on how likely their prediction was to occur.

The last type of user are the ones that make up the Augur Decentralized Oracle System. These users stake the REP token on their report of the outcome of market questions. Their reports are what determine if the takers get paid for correct predictions. If their report matches the majority or reports, then they receive their staked REP back plus a portion of the reporting fees.

## ICO & Price History

In August 2015 8.8 million of the total 11 million supply of REP tokens was sold in one of the first ICOs. The tokens were initially sold at a price of $0.60 each, earning the team $5 million. In October 2016 these pre-sale tokens were distributed to buyers on the Augur network. The remaining 20% of tokens were distributed amongst the Augur team, advisors, and foundation.

The REP token first hit markets on October 27, 2015, trading at a price of $1.47. Being an older coin there have been plenty of ups and downs, but the highest price was $117.92 on January 10, 2018. REP's current price is ${{price_usd}}, with a market cap of ${{market_cap_usd}}.
