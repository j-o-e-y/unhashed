##About Bytom

Bytom is a blockchain protocol that can be used for creating and interacting with tokenized representations of physical assets and smart contracts. Any type of information, such as currencies, debts, securities, or dividends, can be digitized and interacted with on Bytom's chain.

Bytom was founded in 2014 by Chang Jia and Duan Xinxing, two well known individuals in the cryptocurrency space. Chang was the founder of 8btc.com, the most popular Bitcoin news forum in China. While Duan previously worked at the popular cryptocurrency exchange, OKCoin, as their Vice President.

The technology behind Bytom is a three tiered system. The foundation is the Shared Ledger Layer that prevents double spending by using a blockchain and transaction model similar to Bitcoin's. The blockchain is secured with Proof-of-Work mining which uses an algorithm focused on being ASIC friendly and hardware that is AI friendly. The team hopes that as the mining hardware becomes outdated it can be re-purposed in the AI industry.

The next level is the Contract Layer where there are two types of contracts, Genesis and General Contracts. Genesis Contracts validate and execute actions from smart contracts, whereas General Contracts transfer and deploy assets.

The final piece of the Bytom architecture is the Application Layer. This is where users create and use smart contracts, as well as digitize and interact with assets on the chain. Actions made on the Application Layer trigger events on the Contract Layer.

Bytom has employed an autonomous governance structure to oversee the short and long term development, as outlined in their [Economic White Paper](https://medium.com/@Bytom_Official/bytom-economic-white-paper-e027ac5ac139). There are various committees and a foundation that are all tasked with preserving the rights of invested parties, and at the same time checking and balancing each other.
