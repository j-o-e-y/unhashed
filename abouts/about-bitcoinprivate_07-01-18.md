##About Bitcoin Private

Bitcoin Private (BTCP) is a cryptocurrency that is forked from ZClassic's (ZCL) code, which offers the optional privacy of shielded addresses. Transactions made between shielded addresses utilize cutting edge cryptography to hide the sender, receiver, and amounts on the blockchain.

The Bitcoin Private idea was first presented by the ZClassic development community, lead by Rhett Creighton. Rhett was the founder of ZClassic, which he made by forking ZCash (ZEC) in November 2016 and removing their developerâ€™s tax. After prolonged inactivity on ZClassic, Rhett and the [team](https://btcprivate.org/team.html) reappeared in December 2017. They ended up leaving again just days later to start Bitcoin Private.

Bitcoin Private's flagship feature is their inherited [zk-SNARK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof) technology originally developed and implemented by the ZCash team. This gives users the option of creating shielded addresses in addition to normal addresses.

Normal addresses act exactly the same as Bitcoin's addresses with completely transparent transactions that are recorded for all time on the blockchain. Shielded addresses, on the other hand, create and receive transactions that are completely opaque on the blockchain. This keeps all transactional data hidden from parties outside of the sender and receiver.

On the roadmap for Bitcoin Private is rebasing the part of their code that was passed down from Bitcoin. This will bring them the advantages of some of Bitcoin's new technologies such as Segwit and the Lightning Network. In addition to bug fixes and scaling solutions, the team also plans on increasing privacy by integrating Tor and making shielded addresses and transactions default.

##Coin Distribution & Price History

Bitcoin Private was the first so-called "merge-fork" coin. This means that while the code was forked from the ZClassic, the original coin distribution set was taken from both Bitcoin and Zclassic. This was done by taking a snapshot of the BTC and ZCL blockchain on February 28, 2018.

Upon launch of the Bitcoin Private mainnet on March 2, 2018, BTCP was issued to all holders of BTC or ZCL at the time of the snapshot. Creating an available supply of just under 20.5M out of a total supply of 21M. This leaves only 2.5% of the supply left to pay miners for the future security of the blockchain.

BTCP was first available to trade on exchanges on March 10, 2018 at a price of $65.82. The coin experienced an all time high on April 21, 2018 reaching a price of $77.15. Bitcoin Private's current price is ${{price_usd}}, with a market cap of ${{market_cap_usd}}.
