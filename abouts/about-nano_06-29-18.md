##About Nano

Nano (re-branded from Raiblocks) is a cryptocurrency that focuses solely on delivering a secure digital asset that has fast and feeless transactions without an environmental impact. They are able to achieve this with their groundbreaking DAG solution, called the Block Lattice, and a delegated Proof-of-Stake (dPoS) consensus mechanism.

The original Raiblocks project began as an idea of Colin LeMahieu's in 2014, which was shortly followed by the [white paper](https://nano.org/en/whitepaper) and the first lines of code being uploaded to [Github](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks). The mainnet was launched mid 2017, and soon after many developers got to see for the first time the potential of this system. This led to an influx of new coders offering their support to the founder. One of the first things the new team did together was change the name of the project to Nano in January 2018.

To provide users the experience of instant, feeless transactions, Nano had to put together to right combination of technologies. The first step toward their goal came with the invention of their unique ledger, the Block Lattice. This uses account style addresses like in Ethereum, except in Nano each address keeps its own blockchain. The Block Lattice gets its name from the structure that emerges when envisioning the communication of balance changes between the individual block chains of each address.

Having the addresses keeping track of every deposit and debit offloads the vast majority of data on the global ledger to the users that are actually creating the data. This has had the effect of a ledger that is just about 1.7GB in size after processing over 4 million transactions, offering tremendous scaling potential.

To accomplish their goal of feeless transactions, the team had to first come up with a way to protect against spam. They did this by implementing a small amount of Proof-of-Work that the sender and receiver must do for each transaction. To keep transactions feeling instant they invented a way to be prepared by doing the work ahead of time.

Lastly, in order to protect against double spending and come to consensus on the global ledger, Nano uses a dPoS system. This is similar to a typical Proof-of-Stake system, where nodes vote on consensus and the weight of their vote is determined by coins staked. However, in Nano's system users can delegate their votes to representative nodes of their choice.

##ICO & Price History

Nano was distributed for free, at a rate of 17,000 per hour, via online faucets that used CAPTCHAs as a limiter. The faucets began in early 2016 and ran through October 2017. Out of a total supply of just over 340M, 133M (39%) were distributed via the faucet, 7M was kept in a fund to pay developers, and the remaining 207M were destroyed.

The first trading of Nano was on March 06, 2017 at a price of $0.009. Their all time high was on January 2, 2018 reaching a value of $34.43. Nano's current price is ${{price_usd}}, with a market cap of ${{market_cap_usd}}.
