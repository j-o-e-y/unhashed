#About Basic Attention Token

Basic Attention Token (BAT) is an open [source](https://github.com/brave-intl/bat-ledger) advertising platform for digital content which uses an ERC-20 token as its currency. Advertisers, content creators, and end users can each exchange BAT in a way which is meant to create a self sustaining economy while maintaining user privacy.

BAT was founded by [Brendan Eich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich), a programmer and entrepreneur. Brendan is also the CEO of Brave Software, co-founder of the Mozilla project, and creator of the JavaScript programming language. Through his years of devotion to technological advancement, Brendan has earned himself much respect.

It's this respect within the industry which surely has helped Brendan to attract a [team](https://basicattentiontoken.org/about/) of talented coders, engineers, and business professionals. Just about every person on the team has a background with multiple companies or software teams that are highly acclaimed. There is definitely no shortage of potential when it comes to the people behind BAT.

The BAT platform is made up of several different components including an ad exchange, an analytical statistics dashboard, tools for targeting ads, an attention measurement system, and reward programs. These are all meant to be integrated within the users application. The first application to integrate BAT is [Brave](https://brave.com/).

Brave is an open [source](https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop) browser focused on blocking ads, trackers, and mining scripts. By applying the BAT platform, Brave hopes to offer users and content creators a more enjoyable and effective experience online. The browser is available on Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, and Windows.

When using Brave, the original advertisements are either blocked or replaced with ads originating from the BAT platform. Advertisers pay the Brave company, the publisher/content creator, and the viewers in BAT for ad space and attention given. Through the analytics dashboard, advertisers receive statistics about the effectiveness of their ads which are anonymized to protect user's privacy.

The publishers can use BAT earned through hosting ads to buy their own ad space elsewhere, or cash out on an exchange to generate an income for their work. Users generate BAT by giving their attention to targeted advertisements. They can use their BAT to fund their favorite content creators with monthly subscriptions, donations, or premium content. Users can also pay Brave to avoid ads all together.

Even though Brave is the only application to use the BAT platform right now, BAT is not restricted to it. The team is working on getting more applications on board, which is a goal on their [roadmap](https://basicattentiontoken.org/bat-roadmap-1-0/) for the end of 2018. The BAT team envision applications such as other browsers, chat/messaging apps, games, TVs, and more using their platform.
