## About Stratis

Stratis (STRAT) is an open [source](https://github.com/stratisproject/StratisBitcoinFullNode) platform for issuing new tokens and executing smart contracts. The goal of the project is to lower the learning curve associated with launching a new token by creating powerful and intuitive tools which make use of familiar coding languages.

Stratis was founded by its current CEO, Chris Trew, in 2016. Working with Chris is a small [team](https://stratisplatform.com/team/) with diverse backgrounds and experiences, all sharing an interest in blockchain technology. This team develops the supportive framework of the Stratis platform, and provides consulting services to those building on top of it.
