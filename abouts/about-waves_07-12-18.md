## About Waves

Waves (WAVES) is an open [source](https://github.com/WAVESPLATFORM/) platform for storing, issuing, and trading digital assets. The design uses a blockchain for persistent data storage, and their wallet has a DEX built-in which uses the native WAVES token for exchange fees.

The founder of Waves is Alexander "Sasha" Ivanov, who previously founded the Coinomat exchange and was involved in other cryptocurrencies. Sasha first proposed the idea of Waves in early 2016 to address what he saw as adoption barriers such as speed, scalability, and user experience. In November 2016 the platform had officially launched its testnet. A few months later Sasha formed the Swiss company, Waves Platform AG, to oversee the project; where he currently maintains the position of CEO.

Waves allows users to issue new assets on its blockchain that can use one of the default transaction types, or can create their own. These new tokens can have the features of their transaction types added to the Waves main chain by the use of plug-ins. This allows deployment of new tokens to scales with demand.

To secure the blockchain, Waves uses a consensus algorithm called Waves-NG. This is a modified version of the theoretical Bitcoin improvement algorithm, Bitcoin-NG. In the Waves version Proof-of-Stake consensus is used, combined with a forward-looking, elected delegate. This delegate looks at transactions the moment they hit the network and, using some rule set, chooses transactions which can be confirmed immediately.

Miners receive fees per transaction that can be paid in the WAVES currency, or with whatever tokens the miner will accept. There is no block reward in the base protocol, miners only earn through transaction fees. To become a miner, one must run a full node with a balance of at least 1,000 WAVES.

To compensate for the current lack of use, and subsequently unsustainable fees for miners, the developers have created two tokens of their own. The first is the Miners Reward Token (MRT), which is given as a reward with every new block to the miners. MRT can also be used to vote for future changes to the system.

The second token created by the team is the Waves Community Token (WCT). WCT is distributed to WAVES holders, on a monthly basis, proportional to the WAVES they hold. The team hopes this will inspire more people to become mining nodes over time, increasing the decentralization and security of the network. WCT can be used by the community to vote on the legitimacy of future crowd sale events.

To tie the entire Waves ecosystem together, the developers have included a distributed exchange into the wallet. This way users can trade peer to peer with tokens created on the Waves platform, and even includes popular cryptocurrency and fiat gateways. They are able to achieve this by directly integrating third party services in the wallet.
