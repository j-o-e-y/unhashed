##About Ontology

Ontology aims to be a platform for decentralized trust and identity management that utilizes smart contracts and multiple blockchains. The Ontology team will design the infrastructure, modules, protocols, and applications for providing a distributed identity framework. Ultimately, they envision that individuals and third party businesses with compliance requirements will find the most utility from their system.

Ontology was created by the company Onchain, whose founders are the same couple that founded NEO, Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. The lead architect of Ontology is Jun Li, and working with him is a large team of over 60 members. The project is open source with development taking place on [Github](https://github.com/ontio).

Ontology's structure is divided into two separate systems, the first of which is the Chain Network. This is the foundation of the platform, running in the background and providing the features that blockchains are known to excel at. This is where node communication and double spend protection occur. This is also where scaling enhancements can be applied. Finally, this layer is where consensus is determined using Ontology's custom algorithm, [VBFT](https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-launches-vbft-a-next-generation-consensus-mechanism-becoming-one-of-the-first-vrf-based-91f782308db4).

The user facing half of the project is referred to as the Trust Ecosystem. This is where Ontology's vision for secure identity management can become a reality. Using four individual chains, this part of the Ontology network will provide the tools to verify and authenticate things such as individuals and property, applications and web sites, and the tools and protocols used to communicate on the internet.

The first three chains on the Trust Ecosystem will log and segregate these different categories of physical things. The final chain in the Trust Ecosystem aggregates the information from the other three chains and will provide a convenient method for searching and retrieving this data.

##ICO & Price History

From October 2017 to January 8, 2018, Ontology held an ICO sale of ONT as NEP-5 tokens on the NEO blockchain. An undisclosed amount of tokens were sold during this event at the rate of 1 ONT = $0.20. In January 2018 there was a first round of airdrops, giving away 1,000 tokens to each person that signed up to an email list. The second round of airdrops will occur after their mainnet launches on June 30, 2018.

Out of a total of 1 billion tokens, around 115 million have been distributed through the ICO and airdrop. The plan for distributing the rest of the tokens is laid out in a [blog post](https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-ont-token-distribution-and-circulating-supply-da96d5540827).

Once the mainnet goes live, holders of the NEP-5 token will exchange for real ONT on Ontology's network. Shortly after that Ontology will become a two token system with ONT producing ONG (gas) for holders. These two tokens will work in the same way as many other two-token smart contract systems, including NEO. ONT will give access to governance and consensus, whereas ONG will be consumed by smart contract execution.

ONT began trading on exchanges on March 8, 2018 at a price of $2.62, with an all time high occurring on May 3, 2018 at a price of $11.06. Ontology's current price is ${{price_usd}}, with a market cap of ${{market_cap_usd}}.
