# What is Blockchain?

Blockchains are the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies, and now are being tested in nearly every industry. Companies ranging from real estate and public records to forecasting and cloud storage are jumping into blockchains. Still many people don't understand what a blockchain is.

Blockchains excel at a very specific function: being a distributed, trustless, immutable ledger for data. Before the invention of blockchains, there was no way to share a database with the entire internet and still trust that its data was reliable. Now we can not only do that, but in the case of Bitcoin, we can use a blockchain to secure a $146 billion network.

In this article I'll help you understand blockchains better by explaining:

## What Does a Blockchain Do?

Blockchains were first thought of in 1991 by a group of cryptographers as a theoretical new type of data structure. It would be another 18 years before a person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto actually put a blockchain into use as the ledger for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin in 2009.

A blockchain is a type of database where the data is organized into groups, called blocks. Each new block uses a cryptographic method, called hashing, to include a reference to the data in the previous block. This creates a chain in the sense that to change any data in a block would in turn change the next block, and so on down the line.

Depending on the difficulty required to add new blocks to the chain, the fact that there is a reference to the previous block makes the chain resistant to mutation. The longer the chain becomes the more resistant it becomes to change. This makes the data on the blockchain extremely secure and reliable.

## How Is a Blockchain Secure?

What does it mean for a blockchain to be secure? Essentially it means that the system is built in such a way that the participants, commonly referred to as "nodes", have more incentive to follow the rules than to break them. So how can a database completely built and maintained by complete strangers be more secure than a bank ledger? It really comes down to two main things: smart planning of reward vs. penalty and decentralization.

### Game Theory

One of the properties that secures a blockchain is the balance between the difficulty in adding new blocks and the reward received for doing so. If the blocks are too difficult to create, no transactions will ever get confirmed. When the blocks are too easy to create, a malicious actor may roll back the chain, give themselves more funds, and then easily build the blocks back.

The analysis of how participants in a competitive system will act in regards to rewards and punishment is referred to as "game theory". Some people will say that the great invention of blockchain had little to do with cryptography or economics, but was instead a brilliant leap forward for global game theory in this technological era. What Satoshi did was use the inherent cost in creating electricity as the penalty and new Bitcoin as the reward. Which did two helpful things, it created and incentive to remain honest and a method by which new coins are generated.

When transactions are made on any cryptocurrency network they are first spread to other nodes and stored in a group waiting to be included in a block. This group of unconfirmed transactions is referred to as the "mempool". In order for these transactions to be included in a block, a certain amount of "work" must be done. The specialized hardware that does this work are referred to as a miners, and they use an amazing amount of electricity to do this.

As long as the reward and difficulty remain in balance, it will always be in a miners best interest to confirm transactions according to the rules. By trying to break the rules, or rewrite part of the blockchain, the miners are penalized with enormous electricity costs. So far no one has come up with an attack that is more profitable than just simply following the rules and confirming transactions.

### Decentralization

Another important feature of a healthy blockchain is to remain decentralized. Which means that there is diversification in the operation of nodes and that there are a sufficient number of them storing the full historical record of every transaction, known as "full nodes". This diversification serves a few purposes, the first of which is to keep everyone else honest. If the only holders of the entire blockchain are the ones that collude to cheat, then the proof of work system can be circumvented.

Another logical reason to have the blockchain distributed widely is to make it difficult to censor. You have to get almost 100% of nodes to agree on the censorship being imposed. Without near majority you would end up with two versions of reality, with some nodes having the censored data and some having the free data. These nodes will stop communicating with each other creating a fork in the history and the coin, possibly with catastrophic effects for both sides.

This type of fork actually happened with Ethereum (ETH) when the devs decided to roll back the blockchain to fix a monumental coding error and a portion of nodes refused to follow. The nodes that refused to follow now have their own coin: Ethereum Classic (ETC).

The last reason to keep the network decentralized is not about security, but still important for the overall health of the system. When new nodes come online, whether they are attempting to acquire the entire blockchain or just check the balance of a single address, they need to request this data from other nodes. If there is not a decent number of nodes out there to serve the data, then the ones that exist can become overloaded easily.

## Why Use a Blockchain?

For decades our digital information has resided in databases that require minimal effort to maintain and are often the responsibility of a single person. If you really think about it, a blockchain seems like the least efficient way possible to store data. So, why use all of the resources required to build and maintain a blockchain? The reason is trust.

In a traditional data storage system there is a lot of trust involved, even if you don't realize it. Think about your bank account. When you spend or deposit money, that action is entered into a database. Your account balance is the sum of the information in this database. Unless an employee of the bank makes a mistake, this information tends to be accurate because the bank has a reputation and often a legal responsibility to do so.

A blockchain allows participants to agree on a public ledger of data without needing to trust a single party involved. The reason that you don't need to trust the participants is because you can trust the laws of thermodynamics. The fact that it costs something to convert energy into electricity is the reason that it will always be irrational to cheat.
