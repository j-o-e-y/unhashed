# What is Cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrency can be defined as most other forms of currency: holdings that can be used as a medium of exchange, store of value, or redeemable token. The differences are that cryptocurrencies only exist digitally and they rely on cryptography to protect against counterfeiting, control inflation, secure storage, and verify the authenticity of transfers.

Traditional value systems require a central authority to secure the network and prevent against double spending. In lieu of a trusting a third party with these responsibilities, which are often abused, cryptocurrencies rely on math and code in order to remove the need for trust.

As defined by Jan Lansky in the paper [_Possible State Approaches to Cryptocurrencies_](http://si-journal.org/index.php/JSI/article/viewFile/335/325), a cryptocurrency is a system which meets the following conditions:

1. The system does not require a central authority, distributed achieve consensus on its state.    
2. The system keeps an overview of cryptocurrency units and their ownership.    
3. The system defines whether new cryptocurrency units can be created. If new cryptocurrency units can be created, the system defines the circumstances of their origin and how to determine the ownership of these new units.    
4. Ownership of cryptocurrency units can be proved exclusively cryptographically.    
5. The system allows transactions to be performed in which ownership of the cryptographic units is changed. A transaction statement can only be issued by an entity proving the current ownership of these units.    
6. If two different instructions for changing the ownership of the same cryptographic units are simultaneously entered, the system performs at most one of them.    

While all of that is factually correct, it misses the bigger picture of what this creation constitutes. We are experiencing, with the invention of cryptocurrencies, a transition that has only happened four times in the last 11,000 years. We are lucky enough to be alive during the newest stage in the evolution of money.

To fully comprehend what cryptocurrencies are you must first know a little about the history of money itself, and then a little history on modern cryptography. Once you know where we've come from you'll be able to comprehend the sheer magnitude of this invention and what it could possibly mean for the future.

## A History of Money

Credit and debt are concepts at least as old as the first human writings. This is known because some of the earliest writing examples that use numbers are accounting ledgers.

Some time between 9,000-6,000 BCE humans started to use livestock and plants as a form of money as opposed to raw barter. This is understood to be the first monetary system and would be sustained until 3,000 BCE with the birth of the Bronze Age. It was at this point that in different parts of the world metal coins, shells, salt, or other various commodities came into use as currencies.

The next step in the development happened between 1,000-500 BCE when standardized coins or tokens came to popularity. At about 1,000 BCE the Zhou Dynasty in China started to use small knives or spades made of bronze as money. Between 700-500 BCE India, China, and cities around the Aegean Sea started to produce metal coins. It was also around this time that minting was first introduced in Greek islands. The minting process subsequently spread to the rest of the world and improved in quality over the next 2,000 years.

The invention of paper money by the Song Dynasty in China during the 11th century was the third major evolutionary step in money's history. The concept of using a paper representation of value was needed because of the insecurity and impracticality of moving metal coins. Over the next 600-700 years the convenience of paper money was accepted by the world at large and it's issuance was consolidated either directly to governments or private entities within their control.

For about a millennium there were various changes and improvements made to the central bank/paper money system, the invention of checks, credit cards, and gift cards being some of the most notable. Then, with the invention and adoption of the internet, even more conveniences were added to this system with the development of online payment networks such as Paypal and Venmo. However, none of these current improvements created a new, more convenient system that would signal a new stage of evolutionary development until the invention of cryptocurrency.

## The Cypherpunks

The earliest attempts at creating a new type of currency for the modern era started with a paper written in 1983 by [David Chaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Chaum). Titled _Blind Signatures for Untraceable Payments_, the paper outlined the cryptography needed to mimic the features of cash electronically. Then, in 1985, Chaum published the paper _Security Without Identification: Transaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete_, taking the thought experiment even further. For almost a decade Chaum's papers didn't materialize into anything until a group of forward thinking technologists got together in the early 90's.

Inspired in part by Chaum's work, in 1992 a retired Intel physicist named Tim May invited a group of friends to his house to discuss privacy and the internet. By the end of the night they had deemed themselves "cypherpunks" and had decided that it was their mission to take privacy and freedom back through the use of modern science and technology, or what they called "crypto-anarchy." The next day Tim published [_The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto_](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html). It was a summary of the ideals that the cypherpunks held and the future they envisioned, which included a form of cryptocurrency. Later in that same year, reinvigorated by the manifesto, Chaum started working on his vision of digital cash.

A few years later, in 1995 Chaum's corporation Digicash built the first digital currency system. It was designed to provide online micropayments with banks controlling inflation and issuance. Digicash also implemented cryptographic methods to create and verify transfers. Digicash lasted for three years with one US bank and various European banks opting to test it. Despite growing use in Europe, the corporation went bankrupt in 1998 and the technology disappeared.

In that same year, [Wei Dai](http://www.weidai.com/) wrote a paper titled _b-money_ which he described as "a scheme for a group of untraceable digital pseudonyms to pay each other with money and to enforce contracts amongst themselves without outside help." A few months later, [Nick Szabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo) created the architecture for a decentralized digital currency system that was called "bit gold," which differed from Digicash (and was more in line with the cypherpunk ideology) by using [proof of work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) to issue new units to participants instead of giving that authority to banks. Bit gold seemed promising to many but was never actually implemented. With that the idea of a distributed, trustless cryptocurrency was forgotten for yet another decade.

## Cryptocurrency is Born

January 9, 2009 marks the fourth step in the evolution of money, and the realization of a key piece to the crypto-anarchist dream: cryptocurrency. It was on this day that Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin code to readers of the cypherpunk mailing list. This was the culmination of 11,000 years of monetary and human development.

As with all disruptive technologies, this one brought with it tremendous advancements in function. In the case of Bitcoin, and most other cryptocurrencies, these advancements consolidated other forms of value meant to add convenience to the legacy banking system. Gift cards, credit cards, cash, checks, and even bank accounts themselves can all be achieved securely on global scale.

However, Bitcoin was only the first application. Soon after Satoshi Nakamoto introduced the world to the concept of cryptocurrencies and blockchains others started to work on applications beyond currency. Ethereum is using these technologies to build a platform for smart contracts and decentralized applications which are currently disrupting traditional stocks and share offerings. Namecoin is aiming at upsetting the current state of identification, and Factom is attempting to improve and decentralize notarization and proofs; both by storing this data on their respective blockchains.

## The Future of Cryptocurrencies

So, here we are, at the beginning of a transition from an economic system that stretches back hundreds of years to a system that was first described 35 years ago. In less than a decade we're seeing that cryptocurrencies have brought with them a new excitement to the world of economics. People are using them in ways their developers could not have fathomed, and pushing the limits of what initially was thought to be possible. I don't know if Satoshi, or any of the cypherpunks, could have ever predicted that in just under a decade there would be so much adoption of this revolutionary technology.

Much like with the early internet, the hurdles that cryptocurrencies have faced became the seeds of creation for countless new technological breakthroughs. In the short term future we are going to see scaling features on a second layer, like the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/). These will bring cryptocurrencies into the world of micropayments and machine to machine payments. They'll also allow for atomic swaps of cryptocurrencies without trust, upsetting businesses that charge for this service like Changelly and Shapeshift.

As we move further from the traditional banking system we will see more and more companies and individuals creating their own cryptocurrencies for specific use cases. If you thought there was [a lot of ICOs](https://archive.is/NNnUS) now, just wait until it becomes standard that ever person with an idea and a business plan has an ICO to go along with it.

With less need to trade for national currencies we will start to see the demise of cryptocurrency exchanges. It's likely that the NYSE and other stock exchanges will switch to a cryptocurrency system as they can provide better security and either transparency or privacy. This would likely lead to P2P exchanges where different cryptocurrencies that represent cash, stocks, shares, and other tokens are all traded for each other completely free from third parties.

The long term is anyones guess, but without question we will see global adoption of this tech. Some nations will create their own cryptocurrencies, like [Petro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro_(cryptocurrency)), but places like the EU may choose to use an established one that is without geographical bias. There may eventually be so many choices of cryptocurrency that their use will become expressive. People might choose their coins or tokens in the same way that they choose their clothes or cars.

## Conclusion

Sure it took a long time to get from using livestock and plant money to the birth of Bitcoin, but it couldn't have happened without the countless inventions along the way that made it possible. Electricity, computers, the internet, the [crypto wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars), bittorrent, and the work of the cypherpunks all were crucial to the creation of cryptocurrencies.

In this first decade of existence we've seen that cryptocurrencies live up to all that Satoshi promised and more than he could have guessed. There's no way to know for certain what the future holds, but you can be sure that cryptocurrencies will play a significant role.
